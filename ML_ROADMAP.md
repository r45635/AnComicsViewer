# ML Features Development Plan

## Overview
This experimental branch explores advanced AI/ML approaches for comic panel detection to complement or replace the existing heuristic methods.

## Planned Features

### 1. Deep Learning Panel Detection
- **Object Detection Models**: YOLOv8/YOLOv10 for panel bounding box detection
- **Segmentation Models**: Mask R-CNN for precise panel boundaries
- **Custom Comic Dataset**: Training on manga/comic book datasets

### 2. Text/Speech Bubble Detection
- **OCR Integration**: Tesseract or PaddleOCR for text recognition
- **Bubble Segmentation**: Separate detection for speech bubbles vs panels
- **Text-Panel Relationship**: Understanding spatial relationships

### 3. Content Classification
- **Panel Type Classification**: Action, dialogue, establishing shot, etc.
- **Art Style Detection**: Manga vs Western comic styles
- **Reading Order Prediction**: Automatic panel sequence detection

### 4. Advanced Image Processing
- **Super Resolution**: Enhance low-quality scans
- **Noise Reduction**: Clean up artifacts and compression
- **Color Enhancement**: Automatic contrast/brightness adjustment

## Technical Approach

### Model Architecture Options
1. **YOLO-based**: Fast, real-time detection
2. **Mask R-CNN**: Precise segmentation
3. **Vision Transformer**: Modern attention-based approach
4. **Hybrid**: Combine heuristic + ML for best results

### Training Strategy
1. **Transfer Learning**: Start with COCO-pretrained models
2. **Fine-tuning**: Adapt to comic book domain
3. **Data Augmentation**: Rotation, scaling, color variations
4. **Synthetic Data**: Generate training examples

### Integration Plan
1. **Dual Mode**: Keep heuristic as fallback
2. **Model Switching**: UI option to choose detection method
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Compare ML vs heuristic results
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Speed and accuracy metrics

## Getting Started
1. Install ML dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-ml.txt`
2. Download pre-trained models: `python ml/utils/download_models.py`
3. Run benchmarks: `python ml/benchmark.py`
4. Train custom model: `python ml/training/train_yolo.py`

## Notes
- This branch is experimental and may have breaking changes
- Models will be large (50-500MB) - consider Git LFS
- GPU recommended for training (CPU inference supported)
- Keep heuristic method as stable fallback
